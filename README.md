# MyPertamina Sentiment Analysis

MyPertamina Sentiment Analysis is a web application that helps users analyze the sentiment of text data, particularly reviews from the MyPertamina mobile app. Built with Laravel and AI/ML technologies, it provides an intuitive interface for sentiment prediction.

## Project Origin

This web application serves as a user-friendly interface for the [original sentiment analysis model](https://github.com/Silvikusuma04/Analisis-Sentimen-Mypertamina) by [Silvikusuma04](https://github.com/Silvikusuma04/). The model was trained on 20,000+ reviews scraped from the MyPertamina app on Google Play Store.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis:** Classify text as positive, negative, or neutral with high accuracy
- **Bahasa Indonesia Support:** Specialized in analyzing Indonesian language text
- **User History:** Track all your previous sentiment analyses
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system with email verification
- **Mobile Responsive:** Works seamlessly across devices of all sizes

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** PHP with Laravel framework
- **Frontend:** Blade templates with JavaScript
- **Machine Learning:** LSTM neural network model with 92% accuracy
- **Package Management:** Composer (PHP) and NPM (JavaScript)
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL (configure as needed)
- **Styling:** Tailwind and DaisyUI with responsive design principles
- **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run with GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **ML API:** [Sentiment Analysis API](https://sentimen-analisis-pertamina-325126223708.us-central1.run.app) running on Google Cloud Run

npm run build
```

> **Note:** Make sure to set the APP_DEBUG to `false` in the `.env` file for production environments.

## ML Model
The sentiment analysis model was trained on 20,000+ reviews from the MyPertamina app. Three different approaches were tested:


| Model | Feature Extraction | Data Split | Training Accuracy | Testing Accuracy |
| ----- | ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| ANN   | TF-IDF             | 80:20      | 97%               | 89%              |
| SVM   | TF-IDF             | 70:30      | 99%               | 88%              |
| LSTM  | Embedding          | 90:10      | 97%               | 92%              |


The LSTM model was selected for deployment due to its superior testing accuracy.
